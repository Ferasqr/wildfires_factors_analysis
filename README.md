## Project Overview

Wildfires are influenced by a complex interplay of environmental conditions and human activities. This project leverages Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Python to collect, preprocess, and analyze a wide range of data, including climatic variables, vegetation indices, topographic features, and human impact indicators. By employing a hexagon tiling-sampling method, the study extracts data points from specific global regions to enhance prediction accuracy.
