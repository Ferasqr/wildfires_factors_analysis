# Machine Learning Analysis of Factors Influencing Wildfire Distribution

This repository contains the code and documentation for the project titled "Machine Learning Analysis of Factors Influencing Wildfire Distribution," conducted by Alqrinawi Feras Younis Mahmoud. The study aims to investigate and predict wildfire occurrences by analyzing various environmental and human-related factors using geoinformatics and machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

Wildfires are influenced by a complex interplay of environmental conditions and human activities. This project leverages Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Python to collect, preprocess, and analyze a wide range of data, including climatic variables, vegetation indices, topographic features, and human impact indicators. By employing a hexagon tiling-sampling method, the study extracts data points from specific global regions to enhance prediction accuracy.

## Key Features

- **Data Collection:** Utilizes multiple high-resolution datasets from sources like TerraClimate, NASA GLDAS, MODIS, and Landsat to gather comprehensive environmental and human-related data.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Includes steps such as cloud and shadow removal, noise reduction, and hexagon grid sampling to ensure data quality and consistency.
- - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Provides detailed statistical analysis and visualization of the data to understand the distribution and relationships of various factors.
- **Model Building:** Implements various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM, XGBoost, and Neural Networks, to predict wildfire occurrences.
- **Model Evaluation:** Uses metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC to evaluate model performance.

## Repository Contents

- **Data:** Scripts for data collection, preprocessing, and feature extraction.
- **Models:** Code for training and evaluating different machine learning models.
- **Visualization:** Tools for visualizing data distributions, model performance, and results.
- **Documentation:** Detailed project report, methodology, results, and future development plans.
